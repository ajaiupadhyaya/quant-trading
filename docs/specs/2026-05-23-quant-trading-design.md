# Quant Trading — Design Spec

> **Implementation status:** Production-ready for Alpaca paper trading. Plans 1–6 ✅, plus follow-up PRs landing: walk-forward param grids, Hypothesis property tests, combined-book backtest, SOTA strategy upgrades (PCA pair discovery / Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage / drawdown-leverage curve / inverse-vol sizing), TUI keybindings, smoke-test workflow, **trading safety net** (calendar / reconciliation / risk circuit breaker / `quant doctor`), **academic rigor** (Engle-Granger ADF / Kalman hedge ratios / OOS holdout / cost-sensitivity sweep), **SEC EDGAR PIT fundamentals** + Hou-Xue-Zhang multi-factor, and tear-sheet polish (rolling Sharpe/vol, underwater, round-trip P&L). mypy strict clean; full test suite green. Deferred: Finnhub earnings calendar, frozen tear-sheet PDF diffs, real-money deployment.

**Date:** 2026-05-23
**Status:** Brainstorm complete, ready for writing-plans → implementation
**Repo:** `~/Documents/quant-trading` (new standalone)
**Author context:** Brainstormed in conversation alongside completion of [`news-dashboard`](../../../news-dashboard) Quant Lab v1; this project takes the lessons from v1 (engineering rigor) and adds what v1 lacks (state-of-the-art quant research methodology + serious live-trading discipline).

---

## 0. Problem statement

Build a **fully-fleshed-out, industry-quality systematic trading project** that:

1. Implements **5 named strategies** modeled on what major quant firms (AQR, Bridgewater, Citadel, Jane Street factor strategies, JPM Quant) actually publish about
2. **Trains/backtests each on as much historical data as is freely available** — equities back to 2002+, multi-asset back to ETF inception, fundamentals from SEC EDGAR
3. Uses **state-of-the-art validation methodology** — walk-forward + combinatorial purged cross-validation + deflated Sharpe + regime stress tests + Monte Carlo bootstrap
4. **Trades paper-live on Alpaca** via GitHub Actions daily cron — accumulates a real, public, reproducible track record
5. Exposes a **rich CLI + Textual TUI** for navigating the project, observing live runs, opening tear-sheets, drilling into per-strategy state — terminal-first, no web frontend
6. Is **commit-state-back-to-repo** for transparency — daily equity and trades are append-only parquet files committed by the Actions runner; git history IS the audit trail
7. Lays foundation for **future real-money deployment** as a separate follow-on decision (NOT in scope of this spec; gate is "paper trading shows clear edge over buy-and-hold after 3-6 months")

**Non-goal:** beating the market. The honest expectation is risk-managed exposure with Sharpe 0.5–1.0 after costs, annualized returns 3–8%/yr, with meaningfully different behavior from buy-and-hold (positive in regime drawdowns, negative or flat in strong bull markets). The point is *defensible methodology*, not magic returns.

## 1. Decisions locked in during brainstorm

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **New standalone repo** at `~/Documents/quant-trading` | Single-purpose identity, no clutter from news-dashboard's other domains |
| 2 | **5 strategies**, 3 refined-from-Quant-Lab-v1 + 2 net-new | Spans equity factors, market-neutral, trend, macro-allocation |
| 3 | **GitHub Actions** cron at 15:55 ET for daily rebalance | Free, reliable, no server to maintain, Alpaca API keys as secrets |
| 4 | **CLI-first**, no web frontend | Alpaca's own dashboard shows positions/P&L; CLI + TUI handle observability |
| 5 | **Industry-level rigor** — walk-forward + combinatorial purged CV + deflated Sharpe + regime stress + Monte Carlo | Distinguishes a real research process from a hobbyist backtest |
| 6 | **Free data sources only for Q1** | Alpaca free tier (IEX), FRED, SEC EDGAR, yfinance fallback; SIP paid feed only when intraday is added later |
| 7 | **Commit state back to repo** as audit trail | Beautifully transparent; ~10 KB/day = ~3 MB/year is trivial |
| 8 | **Strategies run independently** — own attribution via `client_order_id` prefix; combined book held in single Alpaca account | Simplest mental model; netting added only if/when real money deployed |
| 9 | **Real money is OUT OF SCOPE** for this spec | Separate later decision gated on 3-6 months of paper-live results |

## 2. Strategy specifications

Each strategy gets the state-of-the-art version, not the textbook one. Effort estimate per strategy assumes the Quant Lab v1 base class + engine already exist and can be ported.

### 2.1 Cross-sectional equity momentum
**Base:** Jegadeesh-Titman 12-1 top-decile, monthly rebalance, S&P 500 universe.
**SOTA enhancements:**
- Trend filter — long only when name's price > 200-day MA (Faber 2007)
- Residual momentum — strip market beta via rolling regression; rank on residual (Blitz-Huij-Martens 2011)
- Volatility scaling — equal risk contribution per name (Asness-Frazzini-Pedersen)
- Cross-asset overlay — separate momentum signal on SPY/EFA/EEM/AGG/GLD; combine
- Weekly partial rebalances to reduce turnover impact (Novy-Marx)

**Parameters to optimize via walk-forward:** lookback (6, 9, 12 months), skip (0, 1), top decile size (5-15%), trend-filter MA period (150, 200, 250).
**Origin:** refine Quant Lab v1's `cross_sectional_momentum.py`.

### 2.2 Multi-factor equity portfolio (long/short)
**Base:** 4-factor (momentum + value + quality + low-vol) equal-weighted.
**SOTA enhancements:**
- Factor zoo curation — start with Hou-Xue-Zhang 6: momentum, value (B/M), quality (gross profitability), investment (asset growth, inverted), low-volatility, size. Drop any that fail validation.
- Hierarchical risk parity weights between factors (Lopez de Prado 2016)
- Factor timing — combine cross-sectional rank with factor-momentum
- Industry-neutral construction — equal sector weights to avoid mechanical tilts
- Long-short dollar-neutral variant — long top quintile, short bottom quintile

**Parameters to optimize:** which factors to include (subset selection), quintile size, sector neutrality on/off, dollar-neutral on/off, lookback periods per factor.
**Origin:** refine Quant Lab v1's `multi_factor_combo.py`.

### 2.3 Statistical arbitrage / pairs trading
**Base:** OLS hedge ratio + z-score threshold on 5 hand-picked pairs.
**SOTA enhancements:**
- Pair discovery via PCA-on-returns clustering (Avellaneda-Lee 2008) — ~50-100 statistical pairs discovered, not hand-picked
- Multi-test cointegration screen — Engle-Granger + Johansen + Phillips-Ouliaris; require ≥2 pass
- Kalman filter for time-varying hedge ratios (Elliott et al. 2005)
- Ornstein-Uhlenbeck spread modeling — fit half-life; only trade pairs with HL ∈ [1, 30] days
- Risk parity within each pair — equal vol-weighted legs
- Portfolio-level overlay — gross-exposure cap, per-pair concentration limit, correlation-regime de-risking

**Parameters:** discovery window (1y, 2y), cointegration alpha (0.01, 0.05), entry z (1.5, 2.0, 2.5), exit z (0, 0.5), max concurrent pairs (20, 50, 100), half-life range bounds.
**Origin:** refine Quant Lab v1's `pairs_trading.py` (currently only 5 hand-picked pairs).

### 2.4 Trend-following multi-asset ETFs (Time-Series Momentum)
**Universe:** SPY (US equities), TLT (LT bonds), IEF (intermediate bonds), GLD (gold), DBC (commodities), VNQ (REITs), EFA (international developed), EEM (emerging).
**SOTA enhancements:**
- Multiple lookback ensemble (Moskowitz-Ooi-Pedersen 2012) — combine 1m, 3m, 6m, 12m signals
- Volatility-scaled positions — each asset sized to contribute equal portfolio vol (target 10% annual)
- Dynamic vol target — scale gross exposure down in high-vol regimes (Hurst-Ooi-Pedersen 2017)
- Drawdown control — reduce leverage as drawdown deepens (Daniel-Moskowitz "managed momentum")
- Long/short — short the negative-trend assets too, not just no-position

**Parameters:** lookback set (which combos), vol target (8-12%), drawdown-leverage curve, short on/off, regime filter on/off.
**Origin:** **net-new**.

### 2.5 Hierarchical Risk Parity all-weather portfolio
**Universe:** same as 2.4, plus optional crypto sleeve (BTC ETF + ETH ETF) toggleable.
**SOTA enhancements:**
- Hierarchical Risk Parity (Lopez de Prado 2016) — hierarchical clustering then recursive bisection; avoids naive equal-risk pitfalls in correlated assets
- Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage covariance estimator
- Constant vol targeting — leverage adjusted monthly to keep realized vol at 10%
- Risk overlay — VIX-based or MA-based regime filter scales gross exposure down in stress periods
- Drift-band rebalancing — rebalance when weights deviate >5% from target

**Parameters:** vol target (8, 10, 12%), drift threshold (3, 5, 7%), regime filter on/off, crypto sleeve on/off.
**Origin:** **net-new**.

## 4. Validation methodology (the "industry level" part)

Every strategy passes through the full battery before going paper-live.

1. **Walk-forward analysis** — 5-year train / 1-year test / 6-month step over 2002-2024.
2. **Combinatorial purged cross-validation** (Lopez de Prado 2018) — prevents look-ahead leakage from overlapping windows. Gold standard for time-series ML.
3. **Deflated Sharpe Ratio** (Bailey & Lopez de Prado 2014) — corrects in-sample best-of-grid Sharpe for multiple-testing bias. A naive 1.0 deflates to ~0.5 after correction.
4. **Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio** — confidence interval that true Sharpe is positive.
5. **Monte Carlo bootstrap on trade-level returns** — 1000-resample CIs on total return, Sharpe, max DD.
6. **Regime stress tests** — separate metrics per regime: 2008 GFC, 2015-16 China selloff, 2020 COVID, 2022 bear, 2024 bull. Tear-sheet shows the breakdown.
7. **Out-of-sample after parameter selection** — explicit 2024+ holdout never used during walk-forward. Final "is this real" test.
8. **Transaction cost sensitivity** — backtest under 0 / 5 / 15 / 30 bps slippage curves.
9. **Per-strategy tear-sheet** built with **quantstats** + custom additions for the above.

**Pass criteria for going paper-live:**
- Deflated Sharpe ≥ 0.3
- Positive Monte Carlo lower 5th-percentile total return
- Positive return in ≥3 of the 5 regime stress tests
- Probabilistic Sharpe ≥ 0.7

If a strategy fails any criterion, it stays in `data/backtests/` for transparency but is NOT enabled in the live rebalance Action.

## 5. CLI + TUI interface

### 5.1 `quant` CLI (Click + Rich)

One-shot commands:

```
quant backtest <strategy>              # run full walk-forward, write tear-sheet, open it
quant backtest <strategy> --quick       # skip combinatorial CV + bootstrap, fast iteration
quant validate <strategy>              # full pass/fail validation report
quant rebalance [--dry-run]            # daily live rebalance; --dry-run prints orders only
quant status                           # Rich-formatted account state + per-strategy snapshot
quant tearsheet <strategy>             # opens HTML tear-sheet in default browser
quant journal [--since YYYY-MM-DD]     # structured trade log, optionally filtered
quant data refresh                     # nightly: refresh all bar caches
quant data inventory                   # show what's in data/, sizes, last-updated dates
```

### 5.2 `quant monitor` TUI (Textual)

Full-screen multi-pane live monitor:

```

**Behaviour:**
- Updates every 60s from Alpaca account API
- Keyboard: ↑↓ in lists, Enter on strategy → drill into per-strategy panel (positions + equity + recent trades for that strategy only)
- `b <slug>` → open tear-sheet in browser
- `r` → force refresh
- `q` → quit
- `?` → help overlay

Implementation: `textual` library, ~500-800 LOC. Drill-down panels swap content within the same layout; navigation is keyboard-driven, no mouse required.

## 7. Operational lifecycle

### 7.1 Initial development (~6 weeks of focused work)

| Week | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 1 | Repo skeleton, CLI scaffolding, data layer (bars + universe + fundamentals + macro), Alpaca client integration |
| 2 | Backtest engine ported from Quant Lab v1 + walk-forward + tear-sheet pipeline |
| 3 | Combinatorial purged CV + deflated Sharpe + bootstrap + regime stress |
| 4 | Strategies 1, 2, 3 (refined ports from Quant Lab v1 with SOTA enhancements) |
| 5 | Strategies 4, 5 (net-new) |
| 6 | TUI, Alpaca paper execution, GitHub Actions wiring, end-to-end smoke |

### 7.2 Steady state (per day)

- **15:30 ET**: nightly Action wakes up (the day before, technically). Refreshes bar cache, fundamentals, macro.
- **15:55 ET weekday**: `daily-rebalance.yml` fires. For each enabled strategy: load chosen params, generate today's signals, compute target positions, submit deltas to Alpaca via `client_order_id` = `<slug>-<date>-<symbol>`. Commit appended `equity.parquet` row + new trades.
- **22:00 ET**: nightly `nightly-backtest.yml` refreshes tear-sheets so the committed HTML stays in sync with the latest data.
- **End of week**: developer runs `quant monitor` to review the week's behavior; runs `quant validate <strategy>` for any strategy whose live behavior is drifting from backtest.

### 7.3 The "go real money" gate (out of scope of this spec)

After 3-6 months of paper-live with at least 3 strategies showing positive deflated Sharpe in BOTH backtest AND live periods, plus regime coverage that includes at least one meaningful drawdown survived intact, write a NEW spec for the real-money phase. That spec will need to add:
- Live-only risk limits (per-strategy max drawdown circuit breakers, per-position size caps)
- Centralized order netting (don't waste spread on offsetting orders)
- Multi-strategy capital allocation (HRP across strategies, not just equal)
- Compliance / tax-loss harvesting / wash-sale handling
- Real-money Alpaca account credentials (separate from paper)
- Pager / on-call alerts (Discord webhook, PagerDuty, etc.)

That is a meaningfully different design and should NOT be confused with paper trading.

---

## 8. Testing & quality bar

- **pytest** with ≥80% coverage on `quant/strategies/`, `quant/backtest/`, `quant/execution/`
- **Type hints throughout**, **ruff** for linting, **mypy** strict mode for the public API surface
- **Hypothesis** property-based tests for the backtest engine and OMS (e.g., simulate_fills invariants)
- **Frozen golden tear-sheets** — for each strategy, commit a reference tear-sheet PDF; CI diffs new tear-sheets against it to catch silent regressions
- **End-to-end smoke** — a separate CI workflow runs `quant rebalance --dry-run` against a snapshot bar cache to confirm the daily rebalance code path doesn't break
- **Paper trade itself acts as the integration test** — over time the live equity should track the OOS portion of the walk-forward backtest within a few percent

---

## 9. Open questions — resolutions

Resolved during implementation; recorded here for the audit trail.

1. **Should the `data/` directory really be committed?** **Yes for now, with Git LFS as a deferred mitigation.** Live equity + trades are tiny (~10 KB/day). Backtest tear-sheets are bigger (~1 MB each, 5 strategies × 1 weekly grid search) but only the most recent versions are kept (workflows overwrite). Revisit at the 5-year mark.
2. **Hard-coded vs. detected regime windows?** **Hard-coded.** They're interpretable, reproducible, and the spec's pass criterion is "positive in ≥3 of 5" which only makes sense with named regimes. Adding HMM/BCPM detection would create a second thing to validate.
3. **`uv` vs `pip`?** **`uv`.** `uv sync --all-extras` is the canonical install path everywhere (local + CI + Actions).
4. **Crypto sleeve in risk-parity — default on or off?** **Off.** Adds 24/7 trading complications, tail risk, and no clear edge over the 8-ETF universe. Toggle remains available via `default_params` if needed.
5. **Backtest start date — 2002 or 2010?** **2010-01-01 is the CLI default; 2015-01-01 is the GitHub Actions default.** 2002 is available manually via `--start 2002-01-01` for any strategy whose universe survives that far back. The shorter default trades regime coverage for faster CI iteration.

Papers and books worth keeping at hand during implementation:
- López de Prado, *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* (2018) — combinatorial purged CV, deflated Sharpe
- López de Prado, *Building Diversified Portfolios that Outperform Out of Sample* (2016) — HRP
- Asness, Moskowitz, Pedersen, *Value and Momentum Everywhere* (2013)
- Moskowitz, Ooi, Pedersen, *Time Series Momentum* (2012)

- Hurst, Ooi, Pedersen, *A Century of Evidence on Trend-Following Investing* (2017)
- Hou, Xue, Zhang, *Replicating Anomalies* (2020) — factor zoo curation

Industry-quality open-source references:
- `vectorbt` (engine used by Quant Lab v1) — keep using
- `quantstats` — keep using for tear-sheets
- `mlfinlab` (paid, but the open-source predecessor is `mlfinpy`) — has combinatorial purged CV reference implementation
- `vnpy`, `lean` — TUI patterns
- `riskfolio-lib` — HRP reference implementation
